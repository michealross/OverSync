// through one of those external bridges is strictly better for the
// user (e.g. native USDC via CCTP v2 instead of an OverSync USDC
// hop).
//
// We expose the route abstraction in v2.0 even though no provider is
// wired up yet, so that v2.1 implementations can ship as additive
// adapters without breaking SDK consumers. A frontend or coordinator
// can iterate `getAvailableRoutes(...)` and present the user with
// "OverSync HTLC" vs "CCTP v2 fast path" choices, and the SDK
// orchestrates whichever the user picks.
//
// v2.0 ships a single built-in route (`oversync-htlc`). Adapters for
// `cctp-v2` and `axelar-its` arrive during the Q1 2027 mainnet
// tranche (see ROADMAP.md).
